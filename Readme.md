# Docker Image for LxLogger

A docker image to run LxLogger with InfluxDB and Grafana. The image are based on 
arm64/debian and was testet on the following host systems:

* [ ] Ubuntu
* [ ] MacOS (Intel)
* [x] MacOS (Apple Silicon)
* [ ] Raspberry Pi 4
* [ ] Synology Diskstation
* [ ] Windows 11

InfluxDB and Grafana are included in the following versions:

| Description  | Value  |
|--------------|--------|
| InfluxDB     | 1.8.10 |
| Grafana      | 9.3.2  |

## Quick Start

To use this image, you need to have Docker installed on your system. You can find the
installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Also, you need
a valid lxlogger download from our shop [here](https://www.lxlogger.de/) which contains
the `lxlogger` binary. This will work with all available editions of LxLogger.

Create the following folders on your docker host system. We need a `influxdb`, `grafana` and
`lxlogger` folder:

* ~/docker/lxlogger/lxlogger
* ~/docker/lxlogger/influxdb
* ~/docker/lxlogger/grafana

Download a copy of the lxlogger- configuration template 
([.lxlogger.toml](https://github.com/6fdigital/docker-lxlogger/blob/master/lxlogger/.lxlogger.toml))
file and save it to the `~/docker/lxlogger/lxlogger` folder. Open the file and provide the Hostname of 
your LoxoneÂ® Miniserver and a valid username and password.

Then unzip the lxlogger download (lxlogger_[edtion]_linux_arm.zip) and copy
the `lxlogger` binary to your `~/docker/lxlogger/lxlogger` folder.

Now you're ready to start the docker container. Open a terminal and execute the following
command (be sure to replace the folder path's with your own):

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name lxlogger \
  -p 3003:3003 \
  -p 8086:8086 \
  -v <path-to-lxlogger-folder>/:/usr/lib/lxlogger \
  -v <path-to-influx-folder>/influxdb/:/var/lib/influxdb \
  -v <path-to-grafana-folder>/grafana/:/var/lib/grafana \
  6fdigital/docker-lxlogger:latest
```

## Commands
To control the state of the container run:
```sh
# stop container
docker stop lxlogger

# start container
docker start lxlogger

# restart container
docker restart lxlogger

# open terminal in container
docker exec -it lxlogger bash
```
